# MA615-Assignment2  
This is an assignment for Boston University MSSP MA615 Fall 2021. Here, I explored two datasets from Gapminder: average self-reported happiness on a scale of 0-100, and the percentage of parliament members that are women.  
The files include:  
"wrangling_code.R" - creating a tidy tibble from the two datasets.  
"visualization_functions.R" - creating a function that creates ggplots from the arguments: tibble, x variable, y variable.  
"presentation.Rmd" - Rmd showing interesting plots and describing what I observed.  
"presentation.html" - corresponding html file.  
the data files used in this assignment.
